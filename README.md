# NDPX Performance Estimator
This project is generated to estimate the NDPX's performance.

The NdpxEstimator estimates the performance of NdpxKernel based on the:
 - shape size
 - #inputs
 - #outputs
 - and, #ops.

As you see, it is just a simple regression model.

## Datasets
I manually collected all the data from the previous experiments.
